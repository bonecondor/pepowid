## Background

I have ADHD (diagnosed, medicated with Vyvanse) but still struggle with brain fog, especially in the afternoons. Came across Semax while researching nootropics and was intrigued by its reputation in Russia for cognitive enhancement. Decided to try it as an adjunct to my existing medication.

## Protocol

Used a pre-made nasal spray from a Russian pharmacy. 200mcg per spray, 3 sprays daily (morning, midday, late afternoon). Kept refrigerated after opening.

Continued Vyvanse 40mg throughout, no changes to my regular medication.

## Timeline

**Week 1-2:** Subtle effects, hard to distinguish from normal variation. Maybe slightly easier to get started on tasks? Could be expectation.

**Week 3-4:** More confident something is happening. Afternoons feel less foggy. Transition between tasks feels smoother. Nothing dramatic.

**Week 5-8:** Effects seem to plateau. Still helpful for afternoon slump but not life-changing. Started questioning whether it's worth the hassle/cost.

**Week 9-12:** Tried increasing to 900mcg daily for final month. No additional benefit, possibly slightly more anxious. Returned to 600mcg, then tapered off.

## Side Effects

- Mild nasal irritation
- Possible slight increase in anxiety at higher doses
- Nothing else notable

## Why Neutral?

Semax did *something*. I'm fairly confident it wasn't pure placebo. The afternoon fog improvement was real and consistent. But:

1. The effect was subtle, not transformative
2. It didn't stack dramatically with my Vyvanse
3. The hassle of ordering internationally + cold chain concerns
4. Cost of ~$50/month for a marginal improvement

For someone without access to better options, or as a standalone nootropic, it might be more impressive. For me, it was a mild optimization that didn't justify continuing.

## What I Learned

- Peptide nootropics exist on a spectrum from "barely perceptible" to "life-changing," depending on baseline
- My expectations were probably too high based on enthusiastic Reddit reports
- The afternoon timing was key; morning doses did little
- Russian pharmaceutical peptides have quality control but supply chain is complicated

## Would I Try Again?

Probably not Semax specifically. I might try NA-Semax-Amidate (more potent analog) if I revisit this category. But overall, the effort-to-benefit ratio wasn't there for my situation.

## Notes for Others

If you're considering Semax:
- Have realistic expectations (this isn't Adderall)
- Morning dosing alone probably won't do much
- Give it at least 4-6 weeks before judging
- The nasal spray format is convenient but verify cold storage in shipping
