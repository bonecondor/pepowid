## Background

I'm a recreational climber who strained my rotator cuff in late summer 2024. MRI showed a partial tear of the supraspinatus. Orthopedist recommended PT and 3-6 months of rest before considering other options. I decided to try BPC-157 alongside PT after reading about its use in tendon healing.

## Protocol

I reconstituted 5mg vials with bacteriostatic water and injected 250mcg subcutaneously twice daily, once in the morning and once before bed. I injected as close to the shoulder as I could manage (deltoid area). Stored reconstituted peptide in the refrigerator.

Continued PT exercises 3x weekly throughout.

## Timeline

**Week 1-2:** No noticeable changes. Injection site occasionally itchy for a few minutes after. No other side effects.

**Week 3-4:** Started noticing less pain during PT exercises. Range of motion improving, though hard to separate from PT effects alone. Sleep felt slightly deeper but could be placebo.

**Week 5-6:** Significant reduction in daily pain. Could reach overhead without wincing for the first time since injury. PT noted faster progress than typical for this type of injury.

**Week 7-8:** Nearly full range of motion restored. Some residual weakness but no pain during normal activities. Stopped injections at end of week 8.

## Side Effects

- Mild injection site redness occasionally (resolved in 30 min)
- Possibly improved sleep quality
- No negative effects observed

## Outcome

I consider this a success. Whether the peptide accelerated healing or I just got lucky with my injury, I can't say for certain. The timeline felt faster than the orthopedist predicted. I'm back to easy climbing routes 3 months post-injury.

## Notes

- This was my first time using any peptide
- I was very careful about sterile technique
- Cost was approximately $180 for the full 8 weeks
- I would use BPC-157 again for a similar injury
