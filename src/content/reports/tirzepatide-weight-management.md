## Background

I've struggled with my weight since my mid-30s. Tried every diet imaginable: keto, IF, calorie counting. Would lose 15-20 lbs, then regain it plus more. My doctor mentioned GLP-1 agonists and I decided to try tirzepatide through a telehealth provider who prescribed from a compounding pharmacy.

## Protocol

Started at 2.5mg weekly for 4 weeks, then titrated up:
- Weeks 1-4: 2.5mg
- Weeks 5-8: 5mg
- Weeks 9-12: 7.5mg
- Weeks 13-16: 10mg
- Weeks 17-24: 12.5mg then 15mg

Injected once weekly, rotating between stomach and thigh. Kept eating intuitively, didn't follow any specific diet, just ate when hungry and stopped when full (which became much easier).

## Timeline

**Month 1 (2.5mg):** Appetite noticeably reduced within first week. Not feeling "stuffed" but just... not thinking about food constantly. Lost 8 lbs. Mild nausea first few days.

**Month 2 (5mg):** Nausea returned briefly with dose increase. Food noise almost completely gone. Down 14 lbs total. Started noticing I was leaving food on my plate without trying.

**Month 3 (7.5mg):** Energy improving as weight dropped. Lost 22 lbs total. Constipation became an issue, so I added fiber supplement and magnesium.

**Month 4 (10mg):** 32 lbs down. Clothes from 5 years ago fit again. Some fatigue, possibly from rapid loss. Made effort to eat more protein.

**Month 5-6 (12.5-15mg):** Loss slowed but continued. Ended at 47 lbs lost. Feeling like a different person.

## Side Effects

- **Nausea:** Moderate first 3-5 days after each dose increase, then resolved
- **Constipation:** Ongoing, manageable with fiber and magnesium
- **Fatigue:** Intermittent, improved with adequate protein
- **Sulfur burps:** Occasional, unpleasant but brief
- **Reduced alcohol tolerance:** One glass of wine now feels like three

## What Surprised Me

The mental shift was more dramatic than the physical. I used to think about food constantly: planning meals, craving snacks, feeling guilty after eating. That mental chatter is just... quiet now. It's hard to describe to someone who hasn't experienced it.

## Concerns

- Long-term unknowns (this is a relatively new class of medication)
- What happens when/if I stop
- Cost without insurance is significant (~$400/month from compounding)
- Muscle loss (I've tried to maintain protein intake but haven't done resistance training consistently)

## Outcome

Life-changing, honestly. My blood pressure normalized, joint pain improved, energy is up. I'm aware this isn't a magic solution and I'll need to figure out maintenance, but for now this has been the most effective intervention I've ever tried for weight.
