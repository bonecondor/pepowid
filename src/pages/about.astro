      <h2 class="text-lg font-medium text-ink mb-3">What This Is</h2>
      <p class="text-muted mb-4">
        Pepowid is a community archive of peptide experiences. We collect self-reported accounts from people who have used research peptides, GLP-1 agonists, and related compounds.
      </p>
      <p class="text-muted">
        The goal is simple: create a searchable, organized repository of real experiences that people can reference when doing their own research. No hype, no sales pitches. Just documented experiences.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-lg font-medium text-ink mb-3">Important Disclaimer</h2>
      <p class="text-muted mb-4">
        <strong class="text-ink">This site documents self-reported experiences with peptides as described by the individuals who used them. It does not recommend, endorse, or validate any substance, dosage, vendor, or practice.</strong>

      <p class="text-muted mb-4">
        Reports are reviewed for clarity and plausibility but are not independently verified. Individual experiences vary widely based on source quality, individual biology, concurrent medications, and many other factors.

      <h2 class="text-lg font-medium text-ink mb-3">Editorial Process</h2>
      <p class="text-muted mb-4">
        All submissions are reviewed before publication. We check for:
      </p>
      <ul class="text-muted space-y-2 mb-4">
        <li>• Sufficient detail (dosing, timeline, outcomes)</li>
        <li>• Plausibility (does this match known effects?)</li>
        <li>• Tone (informational vs. promotional)</li>
        <li>• Safety (does this describe extremely dangerous behavior without acknowledgment?)</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="text-muted">
        We may edit reports for clarity or ask follow-up questions. We don't change the substance of anyone's experience.

    <section class="mb-8">
      <h2 class="text-lg font-medium text-ink mb-3">Vendor Information Policy</h2>
      <p class="text-muted mb-4">
        We include vendor and source information in reports because it's genuinely useful context. Source quality varies significantly and affects outcomes.
      </p>
      <p class="text-muted">
        Including a vendor name is not an endorsement. Patterns in reports (e.g., consistent quality issues from a specific source) will become visible over time.
