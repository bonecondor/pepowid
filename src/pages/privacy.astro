    <section class="mb-8 p-6 bg-white border border-border rounded-lg">
      <p class="text-muted mb-4">
        Pepowid allows submitters to provide an email address along with their experience report. This allows us to contact you when we need to ask follow-up questions or request clarification.
      </p>

      <p class="text-muted mb-4">
        <strong class="text-ink">We attempt to verify unusual reports</strong> — including reports of serious adverse effects, hospitalizations, or outcomes that differ significantly from typical experiences. Very few people include contact info with their submission, which makes verification difficult.
      </p>

      <p class="text-muted mb-4">
        <strong class="text-ink">If you're writing about a serious adverse event</strong> — a hospitalization, lasting side effect, or dangerous interaction — please consider including your email address so we can ask for follow-up details to confirm the report.
      </p>

      <p class="text-muted">
        The more unusual, idiosyncratic, or negative an experience is, the more a contact email address helps establish that the report is genuine. This protects the integrity of the archive and helps other readers trust what they're reading.

      <h2 class="text-lg font-medium text-ink mb-3">How We Handle Your Email</h2>
      <ul class="text-muted space-y-2">
        <li>• <strong class="text-ink">Never publicly displayed</strong> — your email is not shown on your report or anywhere on the site</li>
        <li>• <strong class="text-ink">Limited access</strong> — only site editors can see submission emails</li>
        <li>• <strong class="text-ink">Used only for</strong>: follow-up questions, clarification requests, and notifying you when your report is published</li>
        <li>• <strong class="text-ink">Not shared or sold</strong> — we don't give your email to anyone</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="text-lg font-medium text-ink mb-3">Reader Contact Requests</h2>
      <p class="text-muted mb-4">
        Occasionally, readers ask to contact report authors — usually to ask about their experience with a specific peptide or vendor. If we receive such a request, an editor may forward it to you (if you provided an email). These requests are:
      </p>
      <ul class="text-muted space-y-2">
        <li>• Extremely limited in volume</li>
        <li>• Human-reviewed before forwarding</li>
        <li>• Entirely optional for you to respond to</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="text-muted mt-4">
        Your email is never given directly to the person requesting contact — we act as an intermediary.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h2 class="text-lg font-medium text-ink mb-3">Submitting Without Email</h2>
      <p class="text-muted">
        You can submit a report without providing an email address. However, we may not be able to publish reports that describe unusual or serious outcomes without some way to verify them. If your experience was straightforward, an email is less critical — but it's always helpful.
